# Django based Auction Portal
Built this Auction project as an Annual Project. It allows multiple online auctions at same time. It also have filters on the home page and shows all the auctioned properties.

### SignUp and Log In
A new user can signup by providing details like name, mobile number, address and other details. Once all these are verified, the account of the user will be created.

### Creating an Auction
To create an Auction a person have to first signup or login. Then the user can create an own auction of the property by selecting the property type, providing the minimum
bid amount and the last date for the online auction along with some pics of the property to be posted.

### Bidding in an Auction
To bid on a property, a person have to first login with his/her account. After logging in, there will be a list of all the properties which are currently in their acution
period. The user can select and bid amount of any of these properties but only once. If the user have already bidded a particular amount then he/she will be shown the already
bidded amount and can not bid on further.

## FAQ

#### 1. How can we improve this project ?
We can provide an additional info of maximum bid amount till any date on the particular property. This will help the user to decide the amount that he/she should bid to 
purchase the property.

#### 2. Why a user can't bid on previously bidded particular property again ?
With this feature it prevents multiple bidding at the same property.
